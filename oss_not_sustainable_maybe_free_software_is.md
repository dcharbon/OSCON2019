# If Open Source Software isn't Sustainable, Maybe Free Software Is

Discussed that sustainability often translates to ensuring that developers
get funded more or more often.

Discussed Heartbleed as a juncture that raised the profile of this issue.

Notes that the quick infusion of for-profit corporate cash after heartbleed
didn't make FOSS sustainable.

# ? Is corporate money what FOSS needs ?

Explored the Form 990 filings for OpenStack, a 501 (c) 6 corp.
They raise a lot of money, most goes to management and marketing, not developers.

Doesn't want the VC model for FOSS, it's not sustainable and rife with failure, by
design.

# Software Conservancy and phpMyAdmin

Raised reasonable amounts. Funding several devs in South America, now.
Feels we don't need opulence for FOSS.

# Another example

Abandoned by trade association. Came to conservancy for help. Raised approx $300k, expenses are around
$283K/yr, mix of US and EU devs.

# It's a Wonderful Life

OSS needs George Baileys and healthy communcation with Sam Wainwrights
