# Sustaining FOSS Through Democratizing the Sponsorship Process

* duaneo@indded.com
* @DuaneOBrien
* Head of Open Source at Indeed

How did we choose to donate to webpack
- we use this and should give back
- Sounds excellent
- awesome

In principle, things are thought out and planned

In practice, program head requests a budget, it gets adjusted, you plan how to spend
Then... new opportunities arise...
Senior folks make recommends
High level discussions occur
Reasonable disagreement, followed by compromise

Fine, except
* the discussions are exclusive.
* Decisions aren't transparent
* Teams and individuals must escalate requests... which doesn't work well further down the chain

# Launched FOSS Contributor Fund

Dedicated budget, unrelated to orgs/confs
Projects are nominated by employees
Projects must meet selection criteria
Contributors vote on allocation
Contributors to OSS in company decide the allocation per month!

# Selection criteria:
* OSI-approved license
* Muste be used by Indeed
* Not owned by employee
* Must have a way to receive funds
  * Paypal
  * OpenCollective
  * Some entity that can receive the funds
  
# Goals
* Support and Sustain dependencies
* Drive participation in oss by indeed - incentivize by votes given contribution
* Try something new in sustainability space

What could go wrong?
* Money might not be needed or productive for the project
* Voting might select a problematic project
* Process might break down!
* Might need to curate nominations

Decided to go ahead an try to get buy-in.
Ask: 120K for sustainability (with process above)

You can't get the budget if you don't ask - so always ask

# Measuring success:
* Active recurring participants
  * cActive: ommits, votes, issues opened, etc.
  * Recurring: 2 or more days
  
Contributions went up in January! Graph keeps going up. Participants went up, too! 20 projects
nominated. 5 had been unkown to Duane before the nomination!

Supported: Django

February: Dipped in contribution and participation. Dipped nominations, 6 with 3 carried forward...
really only got 3 nominations

Supported project: git

Nomination process was unclear - folks assumed that a nomination was a once only need...
Perhaps avg contribs going up?? Nope, March went down, a lot. Participation up, but contributions down.
6 projects nominated, 7 participants.

Supported Pandas.

So, how do contributions go down, but participation goes up? How?
Turns out... some folks are vastly more active than others in open source.
So... a dip by the prolific contributors overrepresented in the contribution data!

So... Pay attention to outliers, don't panic, play the long game.

There were a lot of positive indicators - more known github ids of employees, more participation.
April, contributions trend back up, even more participants. 6 projects nominated, first Personal repo nominated.
The personal repo was used daily by folks at indeed. Ended up supporting HomeBrew

So, basline isn't One.
Is visibility improving - can we see partipation, contribution, and importance better?
May - best month for participants, 7 projects nominated, complications arise. One project used tidelift... a subscription
Another project fully open source startup, only give them money by buying a support contract!!
Supported pytest, the tidelift project. Talked with tidelift, then, worked with project through opencollective

Unexpected learnings:
* Learn of who we should get support contracts from!
* May drop req't that project must have way to receive funds.
  Instead, reach out to the project! Ask them - would you be willing to setup a way
  to receive funds? Haven't decided...
  
June, contributions up, not peak, but up. Continued participation growth. 8 proj noms, one came from
dependency analysis. Turns out, one dev responsible for several indirect dependencies! Ultimately supported
ESLint. Well-known projects are getting votes, lesser known ones aren't... still looking to solve

* Need to improve voting process.
* Should do more dependency analysis

# Plans and Dreams

* Deeper dependency Analsys
* Identify projects that need the most help
* Grow participants into maintainers
* Grow corporate participation (in lieu of corporate projects)

# Plans > Dreams

* Talk about the contributor fund. There's a blog: indeedeng.io
* Get 10 potential adopters (Target: Q1 2020)
  Adopt something like Indeeds fund and process
* Starfish - identify participants and contributors by activity on GitHub (today).
GitHub: Indeed/starfish
* CC-licensed outline of process
