# Extreme Open Source: Building an Entire Product in the Open

* Daniel Gruesso, GitLab

# how most software companies work

* Stealth
* All private
* Hybrid
* Open

Need feedback. Barrier for feedback should be very low. Maybe... don't send an NDA to
your users.

No feedback can lead to real problems.

# Gitlab intro

Completely remote
800+
55 countries
over 2000 community contributors

Companies need several products to do dev.
Costly in $.
Costly in people.

Gitlab helps with entire SDLC, single app.
Open Core model.
GitLab CE (open source and free)
GitLab EE (source available, requires a license)

Product Management process documented in public on GitLab.
Leadership strategy, comms from C-suite, all public
Sales handbook also public!
Marketing is also public!

# What we learned

Lot of the things above weren't always available. Learned how powerful being
open was over time and adopted being open as a result.

## public artifacts

share intent with world
Allow users at all levels to participate
Get invaluable real world use cases

Can get direct feedback without going through 3rd parties if it's just all out there.

## Most valuable to share

* Public vision
** where the feature/product is going
** what we're working on
** top issues by cohort

Benefit: Same story from everyone in company! It's in a resource everyone can access!

* Public Roadmap
** Accountability - increase commitment and sense of urgency
** Improvement - shows iteration, progress, growth, enables feedback from users and internal stakeholders!
** User Feedback

User can drill down and talk to dev or prod mgr or other involved!

Have a bot to grab roadmap from issues based on labels and publish as roadmap.
So... editing the roadmap is editing the issues!!

## Public issues

* Validation - community chimes in, positive affirmation and elaboration from real users! Also
Users have picked up and run with the designs and discussion and contributed the solutions!!
* Real-world use cases
* Contributions

## How we codevelop with the community

* Single source of truth
* Same (or greater) attention to community members
* Lower the barrier for entry

### Single source of truth

* Single information repository (issues)
* Record meetings - they use zoom to record, script auto upload to drive after record
* Paste chat (slack) converations into issue. Sometimes discussion gets long and ranging,
copy paste to bring that context along.

### Community members

* Response time - don't make them wait
* Dedicated community champions
* Events

## Unfounded fears

* someone will steal our ideas - rarely happens
* First to market wins - nope
* Security concerns 

## It's not all sunshine and rainbows

* Open == more opinions (prompted and not) - will need to learn to navigate the noise
* Everything up-to-date, always (low bus factor) - more work, more grind
* Time investment - it takes time to be open. But... slow down to move faster. Use automation,
eliminate manual process.

# Summary

* Workin in the open == provide more context
* All artifacts public by default (roadmap, vision, etc.)
* Invest in the community. User feedback huge in gitlab success.
